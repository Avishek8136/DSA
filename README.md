## Setup and Requirements

1. **C/C++ Programs**: 
   - Ensure you have a C/C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or MinGW) installed to compile and run C/C++ files.
   - You can use any IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks) for writing C/C++ code.

2. **Java Programs**: 
   - Ensure that **JDK (Java Development Kit)** is installed to compile and run Java files.
   - Use any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code) for a better development experience.

3. **Python Programs**:
   - Ensure **Python 3** is installed to run the Python scripts.
   - You can use any IDE or text editor (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code) for editing Python code.
